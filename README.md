# rust-learning

A bunch of links to blog posts, articles, videos, etc for learning Rust. Feel free to submit a pull request if you have some links/resources to add. Also, I try to verify that the articles below have some real content (i.e. aren't 2 paragraph blog posts with little information) to ensure I'm not listing "fluff" pieces. If you have an idea for a better way to organize these links, please let me know. As I find similar posts in the "General Topics" section, I will break them out into their own categories.

## Introduction
The official docs is always the best begining, so if you haven't read yet, start by reading [Official docs](http://www.rust-lang.org/). You also have a [ebook version](https://github.com/mkaito/rustdocs_ebook) of the doc.
